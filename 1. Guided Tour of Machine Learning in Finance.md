Teacher: Igor Halperin (NYU Tandon School of Engineering)

Need to learn to read papers because machine learning developing so fast.

Only concentrate on financial field and mainly for practioners. Will not cover things that have no practical use. For example, the prediction of stock prices or stock indices.
