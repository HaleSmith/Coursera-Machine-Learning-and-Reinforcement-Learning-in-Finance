# 1.1 Welcome Note

Teacher: Igor Halperin (NYU Tandon School of Engineering)

Need to learn to read papers because machine learning developing so fast.

Only concentrate on financial field and mainly for practioners. Will not cover things that have no practical use. For example, the prediction of stock prices or stock indices.

Fields: quantitative trading, asset management, banking, and other fields of finance. 

Three takeaways:

1. You will get a good understanding of both core concepts and most important algorithm's of machine learning from scratch.

2. Second, you will learn all this not in abstract but rather in a very hands on way.You will be able to impress your potential employers with a portfolio of interesting and relevant projects on applications of machine learning to problems of practical interest. 

3. And more importantly, you will be able to use your knowledge to build new machine learning models using the libraries that you learned if your business need them.

# 1.2 Specialization Objectives

Main types of machine learning paradigms.

1) Supervised learning.
2) Unsupervised learning.
3) Reinforcement learning.

# 1.3 Specialization Prerequisites

Programming: Python,numpy,pandas,Jupyter,Tensorflow(will cover in class)

Math: Linear Algebra, Probability Theory. For example, eigenvalue decomposition, inverse matrix.

Recommendation: BiliBili videos: 3Blue1Brown videos about Linear Algebra: Very Intuitive.
